#Virtual Binaural Head

Creating binaural sound by panning a sound source using HRTF allows to position the sound in the 3D space with realistic results that can't be achieved using other techniques. This simple web application shows the human binaural hearing by synthetizing the hearing of a monophonic audio source by a virtual head using Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTF). 

This project uses Three.js to render the graphics, which are <a href="http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml#14" target="_blank">Lee Perry-Smith</a> head used under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, and Audio API to spatialize sound using its generic binaural panning. 

The effect will work only if you use headphones, so pick yours and view it here.
